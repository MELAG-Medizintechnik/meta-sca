files/fatal:

    If any error-id from this file is detected while checking source-code
    the build of the recipe is terminaterd and a log message is printed out

    Each line shall contain only a single error-id

files/suppress:

    All Ids from this file will be suppressed while checking.
    This can be used to ignore some error-prone checks or simple
    not fitting checks

    Each line shall contain only a single error-id

Suppression:

    Findings can be suppressed in code be adding
    // NOLINT(<errorid>) (without the <> brackets)
    above the finding line.
    Do it only if you are sure that finding is a false positive.
