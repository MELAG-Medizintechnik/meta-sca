    http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/error-codes.html

files/fatal:

    If any error-id from this file is detected while checking source-code
    the build of the recipe is terminaterd and a log message is printed out

    Each line shall contain only a single error-id

files/suppress:

    All Ids from this file will be suppressed while checking.
    This can be used to ignore some error-prone checks or simple
    not fitting checks

    Each line shall contain only a single error-id

Suppression:

    Findings can be suppressed in code be adding
    # noqa: <error-id> at the end of the corresponding line
    Do it only if you are sure that finding is a false positive.
